Notebooks practicing with PyTorch

[torch_testing.ipynb](torch_testing.ipynb)
- a simple notebook using `torch.nn` and `torch.utils.data` for `FashionMNIST` dataset
- DataLoading, creating model. optimizing model parameters, training, testing and evaluation steps included

[pytorch.ipynb](pytorch.ipynb) 
- How to write a basic neural network from scratch in `PyTorch`
- How the submodules of torch, like `torch.nn` and `torch.utils.data`, make writing performant neural network training and inference code easier
- notebook from `Full Stack Deep Learning`
